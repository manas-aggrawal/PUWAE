Checklist

1. Use meaningful names instead of 1 letter names
2. Purpose statement should be present
3. Unnecessary checks when they are not needed like “foldl” automatically returns base case.
4. Test short circuiting using division by zero or any other failed case in our language.
5. Cover All test cases
6. No “TODOS” in the purpose statement.
7. Store results using “let” to avoid recomputing same result.
